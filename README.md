Html :
i created  division with class wrapper that contains five windows plus the about small window
window one : contains the start button that opens the game by entering the player name 
window two : conatins the map where the player have the ability to choose wich one he want to go to 
window three :contains the bill of lading which is the sheets of the load the player picked in window one 
window four :contains the game's actions :driving,sleeping,resting and fueling 
window five :it shows the player how far he has got 

javascript : 
i had to use three classes :
class 1 : driver 
it represents the player 
class 2 : truck 
it represents the vehicle that the player uses to deliver his loads 
class 3 : city 
the 4 cities replresent the loads player can pick 
the citties they are diffrent based on the load price and the fuel price 

=> the player in the begining enters a valid  name by clicking start the event listner will create a variable of class driver that have the player name as the player 
typed in in window one .
in order to win the game the player will have to return to city one which is his home town and have at least $4000 in his pocket . 
every time you make a load you add more money to your account !
